        <!-- Hello everyone so today I'm going to talk about the Konami Code, what it is, how we can implment it into our websites, and why we might want to do so.  -->
        <!-- the konami code, also known as the most famous cheat code of all time, was first used in 1985 by the video game development team KONAMI, more specifically programmer Kazuhisa Hashimoto. He was designing this, side scrolling, shooting game called Gradius. And you know he made it difficult so it would be a challenge for the players, but he made it, slightly too difficult, so much so that he couldn't play through the whole game himself, which made it almost impossible for him to check bugs. So he created a cheat code, now the famous Konami code, which gave him some dopeeeee powerups so he could play through his game and check for bugs. Now adays used in over 100 games, from Bioshock to the Metal Gear Solid, the konami code has also transitioned itself on to the web. -->
